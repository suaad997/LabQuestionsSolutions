1-Answer:
We will be using two rings, an inner ring and an outer ring.  In the outer loop, we select the elements one by one
 and count the number of times the chosen element will repeat in the inner loop.  We will not use this method other
 useful data provided in questions such as the number range between 1 and n and there are only two repeat items.

2-Answer:
We will use a nested loop and will check each element if the element is present in the array more than once or not.
